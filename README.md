### 1. Fork the `pact-catalog` repository and clone it into your local machine

If you have GitHub CLI tools installed, open a terminal window and run

```sh
gh repo fork https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog.git --clone
```

Otherwise, navigate to the [pact-catalog repository](https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog.git) and fork it in your browser (instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)).

Then, open a terminal window and run

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-id>/pact-catalog.git
```

### 2. Checkout a new branch with your institution's id
=======
### 2. Checkout a new branch with your institution's name
>>>>>>> 17ba26f88090995814bd5f25b231de1177ab0af8

Run

```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
git checkout -b <your-user-id>
```

### 3. Create a new user in the `users` directory

> **_NOTE:_** If you have already created a user, do not create a new one. Instead, please make sure the user you have created is in the `users` directory and that all fields are correct. Then, skip to step 5.

From the parent directory of your local repository run

```sh
touch catalog/users/<your-user-id>.json
```

### 4. Fill in your user's details

Open the `json` file created in step 4. and fill it by adapting the following structure:

<strong>Please note:</strong> All text between angle brackets (`< >`) should be replaced by actual values. Please make sure that the value replacing `<your-user-id>` only includes <strong>lowercase letters and dashes</strong> (instead of whitespace). The value replacing `<solutionprovider | ngo | company>` should be `"solutionprovider"`, `"ngo"`, or `"company"`, depending on your situation.

```javascript
{
  "id": "<your-user-id>", // e.g. 'ABC Corp' has user id "abc" or "abc-corp"
  "kind": "<solutionprovider | ngo | company>", // select one
  "name": "<Your Name>", // e.g. "ABC Corp"
  "email": "<your-email>",
  "website": "<your-website>"
}
```

If you already endorse Data Model Extensions, please include also the field `"extensions_endorsed"`, based on the following structure:
```javascript
 "extensions_endorsed": [
    {
      "namespace": "@<user-id>", // the id of the user that developed the extension
      "extension_name": "<extension-id>",
      "version": "<extension-version>"
    }
  ]
```

Please refer to [this example](/catalog/users/example-institution.json) to see how your `<your-user-id>.json` file should look like.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed and your solution added to the PACT Online Catalog as soon as possible.

> **_NOTE:_** Conformance test results are shown in the `Conformance` tab of a specific solution's page. If the tested solution has not yet been added to the catalog, the test data will not be visible. Rest assured, however, that it is included in the catalog and will become visible as soon as the tested solution is added.
