# Contribute a Conformance Test Result

To contribute a Conformance Test Result, please follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the `pact-catalog` repository and clone it into your local machine

If you have GitHub CLI tools installed, open a terminal window and run

```sh
gh repo fork https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog.git --clone
```

Otherwise, navigate to the [pact-catalog repository](https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog.git) and fork it in your browser (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog.git)).

Then, open a terminal window and run

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-id>/pact-catalog.git
```

(Note: this assumes you have not changed the name of the repository when you forked it.)

### 2. Checkout a new branch with your institution's name

Run

```sh
git checkout -b <your-name>
```

### 3. Create a new `json` file in the `conformance-tests` directory

From the parent directory of your local repository run

```sh
touch catalog/conformance-tests/result-<your-solution-id>-<test-number>.json
```

The `<test-number>` should follow the `XYZ` format. If this is the first test for a particular solution, please replace it with `001`.

### 4. Fill in the conformance test details

Open the `json` file created in step 5. and fill it adapting the following structure:

```json
{
  "tested_solution": {
    "solution_id": "<your-solution-id>",
    "version": "<your-solution-version>"
  },
  "tested_by": {
    "solution_name": "<solution-name>",
    "version": "<solution-version>",
    "solution_id": "<solution-id>"
  },
  "test_result": "PACT conformant",
  "test_date": "<date>",
  "pathfinder_version": "<pathfinder-framework-version>"
}
```

The `"solution_id"` property of the `"tested_by"` attribute is optional, but highly recommended. All other fields are mandatory.

The `<pathfinder-framework-version` can be either `1.0.1` or `2.0.0`.

If your solution was tested for specific extensions, please add also the field `"tests"`, based on the following structure:

```json
  "extensions_tested": [
    {
      "extension": "<extension-id>",
      "version": "<extension-version>"
    }
  ]
```

Please refer to [this example](./catalog/conformance-tests/result-001.json) to see how your conformance test `json` should look like.

### 5. Commit and push your branch

From the parent directory of the repository, run

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add conformance test result <your-solution-id>-<test-number>"
git push origin <your-name>
```

### 6. Open a Pull Request

Go to the original [pact-catalog repository](https://github.com/sine-fdn/pact-catalog), choose the `Pull requests` tab and click the `New pull request` button.
Open a Pull Request to merge the branch `<your-name>` from your forked repository into the `main` branch of the `pact-catalog` repository. Instructions on how to open Pull Requests accross forks can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

<strong>Please note:</strong> All text between angle brackets (`< >`) should be replaced by actual values. Please make sure that the values replacing `<your-name>`, `<your-solution-id>`, `<your-solution-version>`, and `<test-number>` remain consistent. None should contain whitespaces and `<your-solution-version>` should follow the `X.Y.Z` format.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed and your conformance test result added to the PACT Online Catalog as soon as possible.

> **_NOTE:_** Conformance test results are shown in the `Conformance` tab of a specific solution's page. If you have not yet added the tested solution to the catalog, then the data about the test results will not be visible. It will, nevertheless, be included in the catalog, and will become visible as soon as the tested solution is also added.
