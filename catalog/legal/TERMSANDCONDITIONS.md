# SUBMISSION TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The Partnership for Carbon Transparency (“PACT”) is a project of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to increase transparency of carbon emissions (the carbon footprint) across industries and sectors, has established specifications for the exchange of Scope-3 carbon footprint data to enable companies and other persons to exchange their carbon footprint data (the “Specifications”).  PACT invites companies and other persons to submit to PACT for (i) review for compliance with the Specifications and other requirements any technical solution for the exchange of Scope-3 carbon footprint data (“Solution”) and any industry-specific extension to PACT’s data model for the exchange of carbon footprint data (“Extension”), and (ii) upon PACT’s determination of such compliance of such technical solution (“Conforming Solution”) or such compliance of such industry-specific extension (“Conforming Extension”), the publication thereof in PACT’s publicly accessible digital catalog of Conforming Solutions and Conforming Extensions (the “Catalog”), which PACT makes available on this website (or any other, different, or additional website as may be determined by PACT from time to time) (the “Website”). 

These Submission Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) constitutes a legally binding contract between the company or other person who accepts these Terms, or on whose behalf these Terms are accepted, on the Website (“Contributor”) and PACT upon Contributor’s acceptance thereon on the Website.  These Terms govern the submission by Contributor of a Solution (“Proposed Solution”) or an Extension (“Proposed Extension”) for review and determination by PACT whether the Proposed Solution meets the requirements of a Conforming Solution or the Proposed Extension meets the requirements of a Conforming Extension and should be included in the Catalog based on such documentation, materials, and information submitted upon acceptance of these Terms (the “Contributed Material”) and, upon acceptance by PACT, the listing of the Contributed Material as a Conforming Solution or a Conforming Extension in the Catalog.  PACT and Contributor are referred to in these Terms individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”. 

Please read these Terms and the information referred to or linked to in these Terms carefully and ensure that you understand them before accepting these Terms.
